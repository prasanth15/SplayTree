Short Project 7: Binary search trees
Author: Prasanth Kesava Pillai(pxk163630)

Question 1:
BST:
Class file corresponding to this problem is BST.java. All the functions are included in this file.

Question 2:
Splay Trees:
Class file corresponding to this problem is SplayTree.java and it uses Balance.java for rotation.
There are three operations: add, remove and contains implemented in this class.
In addition, there is a SplayDriver.java which generates random add/remove/contains on the SplayTree.java.


For all the questions the rotation methods are implemented as static methods in separate a class Balance (Balance.java) so it could be
Used by all the different algorithms.
